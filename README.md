# Golf Cohort Winter Project

In order to keep up our skills over the Winter Break (and to prevent coding whiplash on January 3), we will be working on our Portfolios and getting them ready for the job hunt.   
The goal of this project is to:
- prepare our Portfolio, 
- get in depth meaningful feedback,
- and hold each other accountable. 

On January 3rd when we come back from break we will be re-presenting our updated portfolios to one another. 

Every student will be a member of a group of 3 or 4. 


# Finishing your Portfolio 

### Title  
  - This should bring people into your site and let them know exactly what you are presenting to them. 
### Elevator pitch
  - A short summary, usually taking 30 secs to explain who you are and what you are looking to accomplish. 
### Links
  -  Should be active and preferably open the link in a new tab
### 3 Projects Displayed
  - Projects are probably the most important part of the portfolio. In the README.md of each project, explain what technologies went into your project, problems you encountered and solutions you came up with. 
  On your portfolio you should have
  - a taste of your project's description 
  - a link to the live project
  - or a video of the project in operation. 
  #### Refactor Old Projects
    - At this point in the cohort we have built out:   
      - Treasure Hunt
      - Pig Latin  
      - Color Box  
      - Tic Tac Toe
      - Dice Roller  
      - Ruby Game  
      - the Portfolio  
      - Wild Life Tracker  
      - "Favorites" with Full Stack Rails   
  - Refurbish, refactor, and polish any of these up so they are ready to display on your portfolio. 


# Accountability 
To accomplish this project everyone will work on their portfolio and receive feedback from their peers.
  - Each member of each team is responsible for checking out their team members portfolios, 
    - making sure they have everything required
    - giving helpful, kind, constructive feedback
  - Each team member will be filling out their own version of the document below. Copy the document and add your name to it (ie winter-project-austin.md)
  - As team members we want to see each other succeed. Over the next two weeks we will need to take time to look over each other portfolios and give each other feedback. This can only be done effectively with deployed portfolios.  

Process: 
  1. Deploy your portfolio and share the link with your team members, ask for feedback.
  2. Team members will provide feedback on your portfolio via slack.
  3. Update your portfolio according to the feedback
  4. Repeat steps 2-3 as needed
  4. Team members will sign off on the updates/ completion of the points given, on their own markdown documents
  
# Demo
 - We will be demoing our live portfolios on January 3rd when we get back. Going over each of the listed points and talking about the projects we refactored as well as some feedback we were able to execute on.
